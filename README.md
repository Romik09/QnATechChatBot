# QnATechChatBot


Title: Creating and hosting a QnA chatbot for Ed-tech.

Problem Statement: The main objective of this web application is to provide a QnA chat bot using QnA maker of Microsoft Azure. It is a conversational AI based web application useful for quick QnA sessions in Ed-Tech Platforms. This bot is capable of providing quick answers of the questions asked by the customers without any delay by human involvement. 

Project Description: Chatbots can address repetitive queries about an upcoming assignment or projects. This frees up a lot of time for teachers to deal with high-priority tasks. Chatbots also engage with each student to decide the areas they need to focus on more. For any student, one of the biggest challenges is how and when to clarify his/her doubts. This chatbot gives students access to step-wise solutions within seconds. “By providing an instant step-wise solution to their questions, it allows students to get their doubts solved without having to buy any subscription or sign-up,” .

Azure Service Used: QnA Maker
